# College Assignments
While in college, my learning was facilitated by the many interesting projects I created and worked on in my various projects. These projects range in tech stacks and complexity, but are mostly simple projects with a singular purpose rather than full-blown applications.

However, I didn't just want to just delete <i>years</i> of work, or leave them sitting in a folder on my computer, never to again see the light of day. So I decided to compile them all here!

## Included Courses
- **CSC 171: Introduction to Computer Science**
     - Hands-on introduction to programming using the Java programming language. Teaches fundamentals of programming and more advanced topics. Emphasizes algorithmic thinking and computational problem solving.
- **CSC 172: Data Structures and Algorithms**
     - Abstract data types and their implementation as concrete data structures in Java. Analysis of the running times of programs operating on such data structures, and basic techniques for program design, analysis, and proof of correctness (e.g. induction and recursion).
- **CSC 173: Computation and Formal Systems**
     - An introduction to some of the most important formal models of computation, and their application to real-world computing problems.
- **CSC 210: Web Programming**
     - Learn influential Web technologies such as HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, the LAMP stack, XML, JSON, Ajax, WebSockets, and modern MVC frameworks.
- **CSC 242: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**
     - Introduces fundamental principles and techniques from Artificial Intelligence, including heuristic search, automated reasoning, handling uncertainty, and machine learning, to prepare students for advanced AI courses.
- **CSC 433: Algorithm and Data Structure Analysis**
     - The topics taught include analysis techniques, sorting, searching, advanced data structures, graphs, string matching, and NP-completeness.
