				"short, at the other end. Someplace on the green is an actual, physical hole (or cup) marked by a flag.\r\n" + 
				"\tAs a player, you have 10 clubs available to you to use to hit your ball around the course. Each\r\n" + 
				"hit is called a shot or stroke.\r\n" + 
				"\tThe first shot on each hole is taken from the tee. Most holes are too long for the tee shot to\r\n" + 
				"reach the green and get into the hole. Subsequent shots are played from where the previous\r\n" + 
				"shot lands and stops. Once the ball reaches the green, you can then only use a special club called a putter \r\n" +
				" to tap the ball towards the hole. Getting the ball to fall into the hole is called “sinking the putt.”\r\n" + 
				"\tThe goal of the game is to get the ball into the hole in as few strokes (shots) as possible. Each hole\r\n" + 
				"is assigned an “expected” number of strokes, called its par. Completing a hole in that number of strokes is\r\n" + 
				"called “making par.” Completing a hole in fewer strokes is called being “under par;” completing it in more\r\n" + 
				"strokes is called being “over par.”"+ 
				"\n\n\tSince this is a virtual game, you need to make sure to read the prompts and type your answers carefully\r\n" +
				"There are also some things that you need to take note of. For example, if the ball goes in, the program asks you\r\n" +
				"if you want to hit again, go to the next tee or quit completely. It’d be ridiculous to hit again if the ball is\r\n" +
				"already in, so you are advised to just go on to the next tee or quit the game";
